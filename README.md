## System Environment

This small project is designed to run on `Linux systems`. The specific flavor of Linux is not restricted as long as the
system supports the standard libraries and system calls used in the code.

---

### Part A: File Operations

`cmp` is a command-line tool to compare two files. It returns 0 if the files are equal and 1 if they are different.

usage: `./cmp <file1> <file2> [-v] [-i]`

  - `-v`: Enable verbose output. The tool will print "equal" or "distinct" in addition to the return value.
  - `-i`: Ignore case when comparing the files. For example, "AAA" and "aaa" will be considered equal.

`copy` is a command-line tool to copy a file to another location and/or with a different name. It returns 0 on success and 1 on failure.

usage: `./copy <source_file> <destination_file> [-v] [-f]`

  - `-v`: Enable verbose output. The tool will print "success" if the file is copied, "target file exists" if the destination file already exists, or "general failure" on other errors.
  - `-f`: Force the tool to overwrite the target file if it already exists.

### Part B: Dynamic Libraries

`codecA` is a shared library that provides encoding and decoding functions. The encoding function converts all lowercase characters to uppercase and all uppercase characters to lowercase. All other characters remain unchanged.

`codecB` is a shared library that provides encoding and decoding functions. The encoding function shifts each character to the 3rd next character by adding 3 to the ASCII value.

Both libraries are reversible, meaning that decoding an encoded string will result in the original string.

`encode` is a command-line tool that utilizes the codec libraries to encode a given message.

usage: `./encode <codec> <message>`

Example:

    $ ./encode codecA aaaBBB
    
will return `AAAbbb`.

`decode` is a command-line tool that utilizes the codec libraries to decode a given message.

usage: `./decode <codec> <message>`

Example:

    $ ./decode codecB EEEddd
    
will return `BBBaaa`.

### Part C: Basic Shell

STShell is a simple shell program for Linux, designed to provide basic functionality such as running CMD tools, handling
signals, output redirection, and piping.

---

## Usage

* ### Running CMD tools
  STShell can run CMD tools that already exist on the system using the fork, exec, and wait system calls. Simply type
  the command followed by its arguments and press Enter to run the tool.

* ### Stopping running tool with Ctrl+C
  Pressing `Ctrl+C` will stop the currently running tool **without killing** the shell itself. The shell uses a signal handler
  to handle the SIGINT signal generated by Ctrl+C.

* ### Redirecting output and piping
  STShell supports output redirection using the ">" and ">>" symbols. It also allows piping with the "|" symbol,
  supporting up to two consecutive pipes. For example, the command `ls -l | grep aaa | wc is` supported.

* ### Exiting the shell
  To stop the shell, simply type the `exit` command and press Enter.

---

## Compilation

To compile the shell program, use the following command in the terminal:
`gcc -o stshell stshell.c` or `make stshell`

This will create an executable file named `stshell`.

---

## Running

To run the STShell, execute the following command in the terminal: `./stshell`

This will start the shell, and you can begin using the supported features.
